>⚠️ This repository is a work-in-progress. Erodite is set to release to app stores at the end of summer 2025.

# Erodite (backend)
## Rationale
Erodite is a gamified sex education mobile app. It's basically a Duolingo but for sex-ed.

 I started this project because of South Korea's arguably concerning lack of sex education in schools. The sex education that does exist is outdated.

I was fortunate enough to grow up abroad and receive proper sex education. The experience has taught me that informed sex education should be a cornerstone of every society.

The backend portion is turning out to be especially fun because it's my first time using an ORM in a Node.js-based environment.
